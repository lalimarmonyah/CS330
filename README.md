# C++ Programming Language

C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language, first released as an extension of the C programming language
with the goal of adding object-oriented programming features to C while retaining its efficiency and low-level capabilities.


## Origins of C++

Created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup and released in 1985, his motivation for creating a new language
stemmed from his experience in programming for his PhD thesis. He had found that Simula, which was considered the first
object-oriented programming language, had features helpful for large software development; he set out to enhance C with
these same effective Simula-like features. So in 1982, Stroustrup Stroustrup started to develop C++, named as such due
to the ‘+’ sign being the increment operator in C.


## Applications of C++

C++ is a versatile programming language with a wide range of applications, including:

- Developing web browsers
- Creating operating systems
- Building desktop and mobile applications
- Game development

Notably, many Microsoft software products are written in C++, including Windows, Microsoft Office,
Visual Studio Code, and Internet Explorer.


## Learning Resources


Here are some valuable resources for learning C++:

- [C++ Tutorial on cplusplus.com](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/)
- [C++ Introduction on W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_intro.asp)
- [C++ Reference on cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/)

For an in-depth understanding of C++, you can also refer to Bjarne Stroustrup's textbook, "The C++ Programming Language, 4th Edition."


## Getting Started

Installation:

 I chose VS Code for my IDE as I am most familiar with it. However, you can also use Eclipse, Atom, or any other IDE that supports C++.

- First, check to see that you have a compiler installed. Clang may already be installed on your Mac, as it was for mine. To check, go to the terminal and type in "clang --version"
- In VS Code, download C++. Then, go to the menu on the left side and click on where it says "Extensions"
- Search for "C/C++" and install.
- To run a program, create and save your file as a C++ file, meaning it should end with ".cpp". You should be able to click Run once the file is created
- For code comments, just add a "//" at the beginning of the line.
