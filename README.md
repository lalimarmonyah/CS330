# C++ Programming Language

C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language, first released as an extension of the C programming language
with the goal of adding object-oriented programming features to C while retaining its efficiency and low-level capabilities.


## Origins of C++

Created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup and released in 1985, his motivation for creating a new language
stemmed from his experience in programming for his PhD thesis. He had found that Simula, which was considered the first
object-oriented programming language, had features helpful for large software development; he set out to enhance C with
these same effective Simula-like features. So in 1982, Stroustrup Stroustrup started to develop C++, named as such due
to the ‘+’ sign being the increment operator in C.


## Applications of C++

C++ is a versatile programming language with a wide range of applications, including:

- Developing web browsers
- Creating operating systems
- Building desktop and mobile applications
- Game development

Notably, many Microsoft software products are written in C++, including Windows, Microsoft Office,
Visual Studio Code, and Internet Explorer.
